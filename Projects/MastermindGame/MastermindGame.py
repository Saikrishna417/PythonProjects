# Rules of the game
# Two players play the game against each other; letâ€™s assume Player 1 and Player 2.

# Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.
# Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.
# If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.
# The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
# Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.
# If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.
# If not, then Player 2 wins the game.
# The real game, however, has proved aesthetics since the numbers are represented by color-coded buttons.
